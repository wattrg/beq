# beq

Will eventually be a simple Boltzmann equation solver

## Installation
From the parent directory of the repository, do a cheaky `make` to build and install. Installing copies creates a new directory in the repo, called `inst` and copies all the required data to that folder, so you need to add it to your path:

```
export BEQ=/path/to/beq/inst
export PATH=${PATH}:/${BEQ}/bin
```
